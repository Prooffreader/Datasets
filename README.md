# Datasets
Datasets I've munged and made

** shakespeare_complete_works_data **

CSV files and an SQL dump created from xml files of all of Shakespeare's plays (including those of disputed/shared authorship) and poems, as well as IPython script used to assemble and parse the data. The xml files come from Ron Severdia's GitHub repo (a previous version, which I've mirrored in this repo).
